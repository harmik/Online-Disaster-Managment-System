            <b><i>General Information about Community Emergency Response Teams</i></b><br />
            <br />
            The Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) Program educates people about disaster
            preparedness for hazards that may impact their area and trains them in basic disaster
            response skills, such as fire safety, light search and rescue, team organization,
            and disaster medical operations. Using the training learned in the classroom and
            during exercises, CERT members can assist others in their neighborhood or workplace
            following an event when professional responders are not immediately available to
            help. CERT members also are encouraged to support emergency response agencies by
            taking a more active role in emergency preparedness projects in their community.
             <br />
