            A disaster supplies kit is simply a collection of basic items your household may need in the event of an 
            emergency.

            <br />
            <br />
            Try to assemble your kit well in advance of an emergency. You may have to evacuate at a moment’s notice and 
            take essentials with you. You will probably not have time to search for the supplies you need or shop for them.

            <br />
            <br />
            You may need to survive on your own after an emergency. . Local officials and relief workers will be on the scene after a disaster but they cannot reach everyone immediately. You could get help in hours or it might take days.This means having your own <a href="food.aspx"><b><u>food</u></b></a>, <a href="water.aspx"><b><u>water</u></b></a> and other <a href="first_aid_kit.aspx"><u><b>BASIC DISASTER SUPPLIES KIT</b></u></a>
            <br />
            <br />
&nbsp;Additionally, basic services such as electricity, gas, water, sewage treatment and telephones may be cut off for days or even a week, or longer. Your supplies kit should contain items to help you manage during these outages.
